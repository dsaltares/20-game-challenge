# The 20 Game Challenge

This is my take on [The 20 game challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/).

Even though I have been making games on and off for many years, I felt a bit overwhelmed with the prospect of starting a big project from scratch, all by myself, in my spare time. That is why I decided to build a bunch of absurdly simple toy games, to warm up and get back into gamedev.

All games are built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). The code is subject to the [MIT license](./LICENSE) but I'm using third-party asset packs for everything else, and so they will be subject to other licenses. Please check each game's `assets.md` file for a comprehensive list.
